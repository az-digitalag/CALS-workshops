# Welcome!

## CCT Data Science Team

#### Supporting reproducible research, data pipelines, and software development in ALVSCE

::: incremental
-   Workshops
-   Drop-in hours
-   "Incubator" program
-   Longer-term collaborations
-   Learn more: <https://datascience.cct.arizona.edu>
:::

## Before we get started

::: incremental
-   These slides (and links!) are available at: \<\>
-   Please make sure you have R and RStudio installed
-   Additionally will need `datadrivencv` R package installed
    -   To do so, use `devtools::install_github("cct-datascience/datadrivencv")`
    -   Requires having `devtools` R package installed
:::

## Learning objectives

::: incremental
We will not be learning:

-   The *content* your CV or resume should have
    -   Check out campus resources like [Student Engagement & Career Development](https://career.arizona.edu/channels/resume-cv-cover-letter/) & [Graduate Center Career Services](https://gradcenter.arizona.edu/career-services)
-   How to program in the R language
:::

## Learning objectives

::: incremental
We *will* be learning:

-   The pros and cons of different R tools for creating resumes
-   How to use the `datadrivencv` R package to create and customize resumes

::: callout-note
You will leave this workshop with a partially complete, custom resume!
:::
:::

## Why use R to do this?

-   Minimize fiddling with formatting
-   Easy to add / update information
-   Increase familiarity with R literate programming tools

## R resume options {.smaller}

::: notes
has anyone used Latex before?
:::

| Option                      | Link                                                                     | Pros                                    | Cons                          |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Quarto template (Latex)     | [quarto-cv repo](https://github.com/schochastics/quarto-cv)              | Multiple templates                      | Uses Latex                    |
| Quarto template (css)       | [Cynthia Huang blog post](https://www.cynthiahqy.com/posts/cv-html-pdf/) | No Latex                                | Requires command line program |
| R Markdown template (Latex) | [vitae R package](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae)            | Maintained package & multiple templates | Uses Latex                    |
| R Markdown template (css)   | [datadrivencv R package](https://github.com/nstrayer/datadrivencv)       | No Latex                                | Unmaintained package          |

## R resume options notes

-   Quarto is newer version of R Markdown
    -   Changing because it's still in active development
    -   Lots of cool new features
    -   No sign that Posit will support resume-making
-   Latex used to format technical documents
    -   Difficult to use
    -   New and easier tool is [typst](https://typst.app/)!

## `datadrivencv` {.smaller}

-   Best option for workshop
-   Created [our own version](https://github.com/cct-datascience/datadrivencv) of it to fix problems
    -   We plan to maintain this
    -   Email us if you have problems!
-   Designed to be used once

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202024-02-28%20at%209.12.01%20AM.png)

If you can't install `datadrivencv`, we have a [template repo](https://github.com/cct-datascience/template_resume_datadrivencv?tab=readme-ov-file) of needed files

# Let's check everyone's installations!

## Generate initial files

```         
library(datadrivencv)
use_datadriven_cv(full_name = "Your Name", data_location = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mq7H8ZiF6k7H_f6rY2eA0sq2Xyxf9msmXv3LPsvSYoo/edit#gid=1730172225")
```

::: incremental
-   Create files with `use_datadriven_cv`
-   Use mostly blank Google Sheet
-   Many additional arguments, see `?use_datadriven_cv`
:::

## Description of initial files

::: notes
walk through each of these
:::

::: incremental
Automatically opens in RStudio:

-   `cv.rmd`: main file for formatting, reading in data files, and some content, e.g., name, logo, section icons
-   `render_cv.r`: run this to get html and pdf files

Created but not opened:

-   `dd_cv.css`: contains css to specify a lot of the formatting, including colors, margins, spacing
-   `cv_printing_functions.r`: contains R functions that do a lot of the printing and parsing; grabs and cleans up parts of data files; these functions are used in `cv.rmd`
:::

## Create resume files

Run `render_cv.r` to create `cv.html` and `cv.pdf`

Click on pdf file to view

## Under the hood details

This uses `pagedown` R package: turns R Markdown into multi-page PDF without Latex, and can include css

# Break!

‚òï

## Customize info

Info is in data files, which have two options:

1.  Google Sheet ‚û°Ô∏è Copy blank Google Sheet and change URL
2.  Local files ‚û°Ô∏è Create with `datadrivencv` function `use_csv_data_storage`

Update these and then rerun `render_cv.r`

## Customize info

üåü Time to practice! üåü

-   Change to your name
-   Add a degree
-   Add your email address

## Customize appearance

Many things can be changed, including:

-   Colors

-   Fonts

-   Image

-   Icons

Multiple places where they could be changed: `cv.rmd`, `dd_cv.css`, data files

Takes some playing around & trial and error

# What do you want to see changed? 

## Putting resume online

::: notes
we won't walk through this, but we can help people do this
:::

Turn folder into git and GitHub repo
