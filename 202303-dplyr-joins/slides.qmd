## Use header level 2 for slide titles

You can include bullets:

-   one

-   two

-   three

Make them incremental by wrapping in `::: incremental` or in visual mode, click the ... button that appears when you hover over the bulleted list

::: incremental
-   first

-   second

-   third
:::

## Images

Include images with markdown.
You can also add them in the visual editor with the "insert" menu

## Code

Read in the data

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
# Read in surveys data
surveys_complete <- read_csv("data_clean/surveys_complete.csv")
monsoon <- read_csv("data_clean/portal-monsoon.csv")
```

Use three dots to put a pause in the slides (also in the Insert menu as "Slide Pause")\

. . .

Explore data

```{r}
str(surveys_complete)
```

## Highlight code

You can highlight specific lines of code with chunk options.
See here: https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/#line-highlighting

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "1|2-3|4"
surveys_monsoon <- 
  surveys_complete %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(paste0(year, "-", month, "-", day)), .before = month) %>%
  inner_join(monsoon, join_by(date >= m_start, date <= m_end, year))
```

This is a slide without a title.
Use three hyphens to make a new slide without a title.
