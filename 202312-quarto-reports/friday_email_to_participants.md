Good morning,

Thank you for registering for the upcoming Wednesday Workshop on "Sharing your research with Quarto reports"! As a reminder, the workshop will take place from 11-1pm on Wednesday, December 6, on Zoom. You should have received a confirmation email with a link to join the Zoom meeting earlier to day (and please reach out if you have not!).

A couple of pre-workshop to-dos:

1. Please make sure you have Quarto and a recent version of RStudio installed. You can install Quarto following the instructions here: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/ You can download the most recent RStudio here: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ If you have any troubles installing Quarto or RStudio, please reply to this email, or come to our Drop-In Hours on Tuesday morning at 9 a.m. (https://datascience.cct.arizona.edu/drop-in-hours) and we will troubleshoot your installation. 

2. A significant part of the workshop will be a hands-on opportunity for you to practice converting an existing R script into a Quarto report. Please come with an R script that you would like to work with!

3. Finally, we're curious about your current level of familiarity with Quarto and related tools. If you have a moment, please fill in this 1-question, anonymous survey ahead of the workshop: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdK5jw6N8Lv0JQed9LiwxPeQ6rLVtgDT4oms78vPbLlow6Fbw/viewform 

That's it! We look forward to seeing you next Wednesday.
