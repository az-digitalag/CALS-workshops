# Welcome!

::: notes
Slot here to show results of pre-workshop survey on who here knows about/uses Quarto.
:::

## Before we get started {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   These slides (and links!) are available at: <https://cct-datascience.quarto.pub/sharing-research-as-quarto-reports/>
-   Please make sure you have RStudio (ver. \>= 2022.07.1) and Quarto installed.
    -   You can check your RStudio version at "Help \> About RStudio". The most recent version of RStudio is available [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
    -   You can check if Quarto is installed by opening a terminal and running `quarto --version`. Install Quarto [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
:::

## Learning objectives

::: incremental
-   Know what Quarto is, what it can do, and how it differs from specific *programming languages* and *markup languages* you may know of.
-   Create your own Quarto report documenting your research.
-   Share your report using Quarto Pub, Posit Connect, email, and/or Github.
-   Know where to go for additional help and/or adventures in Quarto.
:::

## What is Quarto?

::: incremental
-   *"An open-source scientific publishing system"*
-   Integrate code, results, and formatted text within one document
-   Document types range from static .html pages, to slideshows, to interactive dashboards!
-   Published by Posit (formerly RStudio)

## What is Quarto?

![](quarto_order.png)

::: notes
"Open-source publishing system": Sounds vague, but this is what it is.

More specifically, it's a framework for integrating code, executing that code and showing the results, and text into one document.

Document types can be broad.

Published by Posit, but it's *free* and *not just for R*.

This general type of system is called "Literate programming".

## A Quarto example

-   [An example Quarto research report](https://cct-datascience.quarto.pub/quarto-workshop-example)

    -   Or go to the URL: <https://cct-datascience.quarto.pub/quarto-workshop-example>

-   [Source code for this example](https://github.com/diazrenata/squareone-quarto/blob/main/s3_biomass_as_quarto.qmd)

    -   Or go to the URL: <https://github.com/diazrenata/squareone-quarto/blob/main/s3_biomass_as_quarto.qmd>

::: notes
Point out:

-   Formatting
-   In-line code, figures, tables
-   Figure captions
-   Citations
-   Scholarly author tracking
:::

## Cool, but tricky. What are the benefits?

::: incremental
-   Reproducibility

-   Dynamic updating

-   Easy to share - from coauthors to journals to web audiences
:::

## What about RMarkdown?

::: incremental
-   Quarto is the "successor" to .Rmd
-   .Rmd documents translate easily to Quarto
-   *Quarto supports languages beyond R*
-   *Quarto has a greatly expanded range of document types*
:::

## How do I create a Quarto document?

Let's start from this R script: <https://github.com/cct-datascience/workshop-wednesdays/blob/2023-quarto-reports/20231206-quarto-reports/mouse_report.R>

## .R to .Qmd 

::: incremental

1. Create a Quarto document
1. Move code chunks over
1. Add descriptive text
1. Add references
1. Add figure/table cross-references and captions

:::

## How do I turn an .Rmd into a Quarto document?

Example report document available here: <https://github.com/cct-datascience/workshop-wednesdays/blob/2023-quarto-reports/20231206-quarto-reports/mouse_report_RMD.Rmd>


## Technical changes from .Rmd to Quarto

::: incremental
**Most .Rmd documents will render as-is!**

-   Document-level options moved to header

-   `output` changed to `format`

-   Chunk-level options moved from ```` ```{r ....} ```` to `#|` within the chunk

-   `knitr::convert_chunk_header(<file_path>)` helps with conversion

-   <https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html>
:::


## .Rmd to .Qmd

::: incremental

1. Run `knitr::convert_chunk_header`
1. Add additional Quarto features
