## Learning Objectives

::: nonincremental
-   Understand the purpose of and benefits of a lab group handbook

-   Gain a basic understanding of what Quarto can do

-   Get set up using GitHub if you aren't already

-   Create a repository from a template on GitHub

-   Edit Quarto markdown documents and YAML configurations to customize your group's handbook
:::

## Lab Handbook

-   Communicates lab ethos

-   Normalizes and communicates expectations

-   Improves equity among lab members

-   Streamlines and standardizes onboarding and offboarding

-   Holds "institutional knowledge"

::: notes
Tendler et al. describes some scenarios that all result from there being no central go-to place for information about lab expectations:

1.  New lab member sees everyone else as highly productive, puts high expectations on themselves, and works long hours and weekends even though the PI does not expect or want this

2.  Trainee feels uncomfortable about traveling to a particular country for a conference, but doesn't know where or how to raise those concerns

3.  Technician is upset they were not included as a co-author on a paper

4.  PI notices someone is not motivated, but not sure how to start a conversation while being sensitive to their privacy and wellbeing

I'll add another scenario: Lab member leaves after collecting data for an experiment, in the middle of analysis and before writing up.
It then falls on the PI or a new lab member to figure out where their data is, how to interpret and run the code, and write up the manuscript

## Lab Handbook

::: nonincremental
-   *Many* different ways to organize this information

-   Suggested reading: @tendler2023

-   Other good lab handbooks:

    -   [Zipkin Lab](https://github.com/zipkinlab/Policies/)

    -   [Bahlai Lab](https://github.com/BahlaiLab/Policies)

    -   [WIN Physics Group](https://zenodo.org/records/7419211)

::: notes
These are all great examples, especially for inspiration for the content, but today we're going to make something *cooler* than all of them using Quarto.
:::

## {{< iconify simple-icons:quarto >}} Quarto

-   "An open-source scientific and technical publishing system"

-   The successor to RMarkdown (but don't worry if you've never used RMarkdown!)

-   Combines prose, code, and code output into a variety of output formats

![](rstudio-qmd-how-it-works.png){fig-align="center"}

## {{< iconify fa6-brands:github >}} GitHub

-   A platform for sharing files (often code)

-   Enables collaboration via git, a version-control tool

-   Automated deployment of rendered Quarto book to the web

-   Controlled way of merging edits and contributions to your book

## Do I really have time for this?

-   It *is* a time investment to learn these tools

-   Git and Quarto both generally useful for research

-   Both are highly transferable skills for trainees [@braga2023]

-   Can be used for:

    -   Reproducible manuscripts

    -   Collaboration (on code, data, manuscripts)

    -   Setting up a course website

    -   [So much more](https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2023-05-22-quarto-for-academics/)!

# Get Set Up with GitHub

## Hello GitHub, can you hear me?

Goal: get RStudio set up to work with git and GitHub

-   In RStudio: tools \> Global Options \> Git/SVN

-   Check that "Git executable:" isn't blank

-   If it is, you may need to find/install git

    -   [Windows](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git#install-git-windows)
    -   [macOS](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git#macos)

-   Run `usethis::git_sitrep()` and follow steps

## GitHub organizations

::: nonincremental
-   Allow you to manage team members access

-   You (the PI) always have access to everyone's code pushed to the organization

-   When a trainee leaves your lab, their code stays in the lab organization
:::

::: callout-note
## BTW

Encourage trainees in your lab to apply to our [Fall reproducibility workshop series](https://datascience.cct.arizona.edu/events/fall-2024-workshop-series-reproducibility-and-data-science-r)!
:::

## Create your handbook

![](use-template.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Go to our [template on GitHub](https://github.com/cct-datascience/group-handbook-template) and click the "Use Template" button

-   (Optional) choose your newly-created GitHub organization under "Owner"

-   Give your repo a name, e.g. "scott-lab-handbook"

## Open your handbook in RStudio

![](code-btn.png){fig-align="center"}

Next you need to *clone* your repository locally, so you can work on it on your computer

-   In ***your*** repo on GitHub, click the green "\< \> Code" button, copy the url

-   In RStudio, new project \> from version control \> paste url

-   Edit the README, commit, push, and check GitHub

# Quarto

## Preview your book!

Run `quarto preview` in the terminal to see a *live* preview of your lab handbook!

![](quarto_preview.png){fig-align="center"}

## Your book features

::: nonincremental
-   Search bar
-   Dark mode switch
-   Table of contents for book (left) and within pages (right)
-   Links to view and edit source code and report issues on GitHub (these are not "hooked up" yetâ€”we will fix this together)

## Anatomy of a .qmd

```` {.markdown code-line-numbers="|1-7|9-15|10-11|17-19|21-23|" filename="myreport.qmd"}
---
title: "My Report"
author: "Eric Scott"
format: 
  html:
    toc: true
---

```{{r}}
#| label: load-packages
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
```

## Data

My data source is the [gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) dataset.

```{{r}}
head(gapminder)
```
````

::: notes
If this looks familiar to RMarkdown users, that's because Quarto was built on lessons learned from developing RMarkdown.
It includes all the features of RMarkdown and more.
:::

## Markdown Basics

Markdown is a "markup language" that let's you write plain text to indicate formatting.
For example:

::: nonincremental
-   `**bold text**` becomes **bold text**

-   `~~strikethrough~~` becomes ~~strikethrough~~

-   `$E = mc^2$` becomes $E = mc^2$

-   `[link](https://www.google.com)` becomes [link](https://www.google.com)

-   `` `code()` `` becomes `code()`
:::

Check **Help \> Markdown quick reference** in RStudio

## Shortcodes

::: nonincremental
-   Shortcodes look like `{{< something something >}}` and get replaced on render

-   For an example, see `contributing.qmd`

-   Some shortcodes are built-in (like the [`meta` shortcode](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/variables.html#meta)) and some are from [extensions](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/) (like the [`fa` shortcode](https://github.com/quarto-ext/fontawesome))
:::

::: callout-note
You don't *need* to use shortcodes, but there are some already in the template.
:::

## Visual Editor

![](visual_toolbar.png){fig-align="center"}

::: nonincremental
-   Makes editing Quarto documents a lot like editing a Word doc

-   Explore creating sections, lists, tables, images, callouts, and references

-   Open the "add anything" menu with {{< kbd mac=cmd-/ win=ctrl-/ >}}

-   Save changes, practice commit & push
:::

## \_quarto.yml

::: nonincremental
-   YAML works with nested `key: value` pairs.

-   Nesting is indicated with indentation

-   Use `_quarto.yml` to configure your book including adding new chapters and controlling chapter order.
:::

::: callout-tip
Indentation is a common source of frustration with YAMLâ€”the wrong number of spaces can completely break things.
:::

::: notes
Go through \_quarto.yml line-by-line
:::

## Complete (?) list of edits {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
In `_quarto.yml`

::: nonincremental
-   `book: title:`
-   `book: repo-url`
-   `book: author:`
-   `book: date:`
-   Possibly re-order or add new `chapters:`
:::

In `README.md`

::: nonincremental
-   Edit to be about your book
-   Include links to template, your lab website, etc.
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
In `code-of-conduct.qmd`

::: nonincremental
-   Replace `GROUP_NAME`, `PI_NAME`, and `PI_EMAIL`
-   Double-check links to UA policies
:::

In content (all .qmd files)

::: nonincremental
-   Edit and add content!
-   Remove all `.callout-important` boxesâ€”these are just prompts to give ideas for content
:::
:::
:::

## Publish your (WIP) book

::: nonincremental
-   In the terminal, double-check that you're in the project directory
-   Run `quarto publish gh-pages`
-   When successful, it'll create `_publish.yml`â€”commit and push this file
:::

::: callout-note
After manually publishing this first time, you *should* (ðŸ¤ž) be able to just push changes to GitHub and it will automatically re-publish your book
:::
