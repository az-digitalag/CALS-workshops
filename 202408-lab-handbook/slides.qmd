## Lab Handbooks

-   Communicates lab ethos

-   Normalize and communicate expectations

-   Improve equity among lab members

-   Streamline and standardize onboarding and offboarding

## Lab Handbooks

-   *Many* different ways to organize this information

-   Suggested reading: @tendler2023

-   Other good lab handbooks:

    -   [Zipkin Lab](https://github.com/zipkinlab/Policies/)

    -   [Bahlai Lab](https://github.com/BahlaiLab/Policies)

    -   [WIN Physics Group](https://zenodo.org/records/7419211)

<!--# plug supplemental to tendler paper, other group lab notebooks -->

## Quarto

-   "An open-source scientific and technical publishing system"

-   Edit plain text .qmd files that can be rendered to HTML, PDF, Word, Powerpoint, and more!

-   Relatively simple to create a searchable, editable, online book

-   "Language agnostic", but today we will work in RStudio to edit quarto documents

<!--# link to past workshops on Quarto, quarto.org, etc. for learning more -->

## GitHub

-   A platform for sharing files (often code)

-   Enables collaboration via git, a version-control tool

-   Automated deployment of rendered Quarto book to the web

-   Controlled way of making our lab handbook editable

-   Highly transferable skill for trainees, and generally useful for research [@braga2023]

# Get Set Up with GitHub

## Hello GitHub, can you hear me?

Goal: get RStudio set up to work with GitHub

-   Run `usethis::git_sitrep()` to check your status

-   Work through any tasks in the output

## GitHub organizations

-   Allow you to manage team members access

-   You (the PI) always have access to everyone's code pushed to the organization

-   When a trainee leaves your lab, their code stays in the lab organization

-   Encourage your trainees to apply to our Fall workshop series!

## Create your handbook!

-   go to \<URL\> and click the "Use Template" button and create a copy in your newly-created GitHub organization

-   In the copy, click the green button, copy the url

-   Open RStudio, new project, from version control, paste url

-   Edit the README, commit, push, check GitHub

# Quarto

## Preview your book!

-   run `quarto preview` in the terminal to see a *live* preview of your lab handbook!

## Anatomy of a .qmd

<!--# copy slides from fall workshop series -->

## Visual Editor

-   Makes editing Quarto documents a lot like editing a Word doc

-   Explore creating sections, lists, tables, images, callouts, and references

-   Switch to source mode to debug and learn markdown

## Shortcodes and \_variables.yaml

-   Open index.qmd

-   Quarto shortcodes look like `{{< something >}}` and get replaced on render

-   There are a variety of built-in shortcodes and others available through extensions

-   The only shortcodes in this book are `{{< var something >}}` and get replaced by a corresponding variable in `_variables.yml`

-   Edit `_variables.yml` and see how it changes your book

::: callout-note
You do not need to use `var` shortcodes anymore and you can eventually replace them with plain text.
:::

## \_quarto.yml

-   YAML works with nested `key: value` pairs.

-   Nesting is indicated with indentation

-   Use `_quarto.yml` to configure your book including adding new chapters and controlling chapter order.

::: callout-tip
Indentation is a common source of frustration with YAMLâ€”the wrong number of spaces can completely break things.
:::

::: notes
Go through \_quarto.yml line-by-line
